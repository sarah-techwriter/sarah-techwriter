# Hi, im Sarah

A **Technical Writer** who turns complex information into clear, structured documentation for both technical and non-technical audiences. Driven by high curiosity, I enjoy understanding how systems and products work and translating them into user-friendly content. I use modern documentation tools and follow organizational style guides while prioritizing clarity, accuracy, and consistency. 

_Always open to technical writing projects and documentation collaborations._
